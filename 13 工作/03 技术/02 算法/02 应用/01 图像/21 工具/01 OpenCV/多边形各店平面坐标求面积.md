# 已知多边形各点平面坐标求面积

需求一般是：得到一些坐标点，放到坐标系中，生成图表。

例如下面平面坐标 $(x,y)$：



```py
x = [0.00,0.00,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.05,0.07,0.10,0.12,0.15,0.18,0.21,0.24,0.28,0.32,0.37,0.42,0.46,0.52,0.57,0.62,0.68,0.74,0.80,0.86,0.92,0.99,1.06,1.12,1.19,1.26,1.33,1.40,1.48,1.68,1.75,1.82,1.88,1.95,2.01,2.08,2.15,2.21,2.28,2.35,2.41,2.48,2.55,2.61,2.68,2.75,2.81,2.88,2.95,3.01,3.08,3.15,3.21,3.27,3.34,3.39,3.46,3.51,3.58,3.64,3.69,3.75,3.81,3.86,3.92,3.97,4.02,4.08,4.13,4.17,4.22,4.27,4.31,4.36,4.41,4.44,4.49,4.52,4.56,4.60,4.64,4.67,4.71,4.74,4.77,4.80,4.82,4.85,4.87,4.89,4.91,4.93,4.94,4.96,4.97,4.98,4.99,4.99,4.99,4.99,4.99,4.99,4.98,4.97,4.96,4.94,4.93,4.91,4.88,4.86,4.83,4.80,4.77,4.73,4.70,4.66,4.62,4.57,4.52,4.46,4.42,4.36,4.29,4.24,4.18,4.11,4.06,3.99,3.92,3.85,3.78,3.70,3.63,3.55,3.48,3.41,3.33,3.26,3.18,3.09,3.02,2.94,2.85,2.78,2.69,2.61,2.54,2.45,2.37,2.30,2.21,2.13,2.06,1.98,1.89,1.82,1.74,1.67,1.59,1.52,1.45,1.37,1.30,1.23,1.16,1.09,1.03,0.96,0.90,0.84,0.78,0.72,0.67,0.61,0.55,0.51,0.45,0.41,0.36,0.32,0.28,0.24,0.21,0.18,0.14,0.12,0.09,0.07,0.05,0.04,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.00]

平面坐标合围的区域，可以看作为多边形，如何求这样多边形的面积呢？

多边形面积求解的方法很多，其中比较多见的就是增加一个点 P，然后分别连接多边形各个定点与 P 点，然后计算每个三角形的符号面积（面积有正负之分），求和就可以计算出面积。

可以简便些，将 P 点直接放在 A 点，分别累加△ABC、△ACD、△ADE……，此处注意按向量计算，判断顺时针还是逆时针，如果我们假设逆时针的三角形（如上图 ABC）为正，那么顺时针的面积（如上图 AGF）就为负。

其中，三角形面积使用海伦公式，海伦公式又译作希伦公式。它是利用三角形的三条边的边长直接求三角形面积的公式。参考代码如下（注：网上参考代码有误，本文已经更正，请读者帮验证）：


```py

    p1 = points[0]
    for i in range(1,len(points)-1):
        p2 = points[i]
        p3 = points[i + 1]

        #计算向量
        vecp1p2 = Point(p2.x-p1.x,p2.y-p1.y)
        vecp2p3 = Point(p3.x-p2.x,p3.y-p2.y)

        #判断顺时针还是逆时针，顺时针面积为正，逆时针面积为负
        vecMult = vecp1p2.x*vecp2p3.y - vecp1p2.y*vecp2p3.x   #判断正负方向比较有意思
        sign = 0
        if(vecMult>0):
            sign = 1
        elif(vecMult<0):
            sign = -1

        triArea = GetAreaOfTriangle(p1,p2,p3)*sign
        area += triArea
    return abs(area)

    s = (p1p2 + p2p3 + p3p1)/2

    for index in range(len(x)):
        points.append(Point(x[index],y[index]))

    area = GetAreaOfPolyGon(points)
    print(area)
    print(math.ceil(area))
    assert math.ceil(area)==1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
    print("OK")    
```

另外，仍可继续简化算法，采用向量叉乘计算多边形面积。由图知坐标原点（按 P 点为原点）与多边形任意相邻的两个顶点构成一个三角形，而三角形的面积可由三个顶点构成的两个平面向量的外积求得。任意多边形的面积公式：

$$
S_{\Omega}=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} S_{\Delta p_{k} p_{k+1}}=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(x_{k} y_{k+1}-x_{k+1} y_{k}\right)
$$

基于向量叉乘计算多边形面积参考代码如下：

```py
import math

class Point():
    def __init__(self,x,y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

def GetAreaOfPolyGonbyVector(points):
    # 基于向量叉乘计算多边形面积
    area = 0
    if(len(points)<3):

         raise Exception("error")

    for i in range(0,len(points)-1):
        p1 = points[i]
        p2 = points[i + 1]

        triArea = (p1.x*p2.y - p2.x*p1.y)/2
        area += triArea
    return abs(area)

def main():
    points = []

    x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2]
    y = [1,2,2,3,3,3,2,1,1,1]
    for index in range(len(x)):
        points.append(Point(x[index],y[index]))

    area = GetAreaOfPolyGonbyVector(points)
    print(area)
    print(math.ceil(area))
    assert math.ceil(area)==1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
    print("OK")
```

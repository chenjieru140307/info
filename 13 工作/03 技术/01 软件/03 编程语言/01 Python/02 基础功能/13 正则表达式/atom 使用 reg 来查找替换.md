# atom 使用 reg 来查找替换


I want to search and replace this

```
`https://example.com/`{.uri}
```

to

```
[https://example.com/](https://example.com/)
```


If you Cmd-F and open the search pane, there is a ".*" button at the right side. Click it and now it's regex mode.

I find

```
(http.*)\{\.uri\}
```

and replace to

```
[$1]($1)
```

> When doing a regular expression search, the replacement syntax to refer back to search groups is `$1`, `$2`, … `$&`. Refer to JavaScript's guide to regular expressions to learn more about regular expression syntax you can use in Atom.
